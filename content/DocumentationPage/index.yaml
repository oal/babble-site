This is done with PHP's package manager `composer`, as follows:\n\n```bash\ncomposer install\ncomposer dump-autoload -o\n```\n\n### Installing Babble Admin\nTODO.\n"

            body: "When you want to publish your Babble website, the web server's user needs write access to a few directories in order for it to store uploaded files, cache, and update your site's content.\n\n```bash\nmkdir public/uploads\nsudo chmod www-data public/uploads\n\nsudo chown -R www-data content\nsudo chown -R www-data cache\n```\n\nIf you want to use Babble's image cropping functionality, you need either GD or Imagick installed for PHP. On an Ubuntu server, you can run `sudo apt install php-imagick`."

            body: "If you don't need to access Babble Admin, or use any dynamic features on your site, you can build a static version of your website, containing only plain HTML files. This is great for performance, as every page load simply loads a pre-built HTML file, and no PHP is needed.\n\nBuilding a static version of your website is as simple as running:\n\n```bash\nphp babble build\n```\n\nThis command creates a `build` directory inside your project, which contains everything you need to upload to your web server. Then uploading is just a matter of opening your favorite FTP client, or calling an `rsync` or `scp` command:\n\n```\nscp -r ./build/* user@yourserver:/var/www/example.com/\n```"
