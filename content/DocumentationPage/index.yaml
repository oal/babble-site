    - { type: Section, value: { title: Installation, body: "When getting started with Babble, it is recommended to use [babble-quickstart](https://github.com/oal/babble-quickstart) as a starting point.\n\nClone it with Git, install Babble with composer, and start working on you website." } }
    - { type: Section, value: { title: Models, body: "Models are used to describe content structure. They are stored as one file per model, in the \"models\". To define a new model, create a YAML-file with a suitable name (like Page, BlogPost or similar). Note that all models must start with an uppercase letter.\n\nA model may look like this:\n\n**/models/Page.yaml**\n```\nname: Page                    # Model name. May contain multiple words\nhierarchical: true             # Whether or not to support sub records (like sub-pages services/consulting, services/development etc.)\noptions:                           # Used to assign metadata for the admin etc. for the model.\n    admin:\n        icon: database\n        list_display:\n        - id\n        - title\n\nfields:                            # Defines all fields for this model.\n    title:                           # Key used to access data in templates.\n        name: Title            # Descriptive name, like \"name\" for the model itself.\n        type: text               # Type of field.\n\n    body:\n        name: Body\n        type: text\n        options:\n            multiline: true\n\n```" } }
    - { type: Section, value: { title: Content, body: "Content maps data to models, and is stored in the \"content\" directory. It must contain one directory for each model type, so you may have \"/content/Page/\", to put Pages inside. Content files also use YAML, and you use the field keys from the model to specify content for each field.\n\n**/content/Page/index.yaml**\n```\ntitle: Home\nbody: 'This simple demo site is built with Babble. You can use it as a base for your own website, or start from scratch.'\n```" } }
    - { type: Section, value: { title: Templates, body: "Templates are stored in the \"templates\" directory, and are written using the Twig templating language. Babble differentiates between three types of templates.\n\n- Files starting with \"_\". These are ignored. They may be used as a base layout, and templates you want to include from elsewhere. Typically you want a \"_base.twig\" file that contains the page's header and footer, and extend from this.\n- Files starting with a lowercase letter. These are rendered directly. So if you have a file called \"about.twig\", and go to \"yoursite.tld/about\", this page will be loaded.\n- Files starting with an uppercase letter. These map to models. If you have a file called \"Page.twig\", it will match all \"Page\" records based on ID. If you have a file \"/content/Page/contact.yaml\", \"yoursite.tld/contact\" will load this page. Inside capitalized template files, \"this\" is bound to the matching record, so you can use \"{{ this.title }}\" to show the contact page's title in this example.\n\n**/templates/_base.twig**\n```\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} - {{ site.title }}</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/static/main.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<header id=\"header\">\n    <h2>\n        <a href=\"/\">\n            <img src=\"/static/logo.svg\" alt=\"Babble CMS\">\n        </a>\n    </h2>\n    <nav>\n        <ul>\n            {% for page in Page.all() %}\n                <li>\n                    <a href=\"/{{ page.id }}\">{{ page.title }}</a>\n                </li>\n            {% endfor %}\n        </ul>\n    </nav>\n</header>\n\n{% block body %}\n{% endblock %}\n\n<footer id=\"footer\">\n    Powered by Babble CMS.\n</footer>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**/templates/Page.twig**\n```\n{% extends '_base.twig' %}\n\n{% block title %}{{ this.title }}{% endblock %}\n\n{% block body %}\n    <div id=\"content\">\n        <h1>{{ this.title }}</h1>\n        <div>\n            {{ this.body }}\n        </div>\n    </div>\n{% endblock %}\n```" } }
