                When getting started with Babble, it is recommended to use [babble-quickstart](https://github.com/oal/babble-quickstart) as a starting point.
                
                ### Downloading the quickstart project
                You can either use `git` to clone the Quickstart project, or you can [download it as a zip file](https://github.com/oal/babble-quickstart/archive/master.zip).
                
                
                ```bash
                git clone https://github.com/oal/babble-quickstart.git my-project
                cd my-project
                ```
                
                ### Installing dependencies
                The next step of the process is to install Babble into your project. This is done with PHP's package manager `composer`, as follows:
                
                ```bash
                composer install
                composer dump-autoload -o
                ```
                
                ### Installing Babble Admin
                To install Babble Admin, you have to either clone the `babble-admin` repository using Git, [or download the zip](https://github.com/oal/babble-admin) (similar to setting up the quickstart project above).
                
                ```bash
                cd my-project
                mkdir assets
                cd assets
                git clone https://github.com/oal/babble-admin.git admin
                ```
                
                When the above commands have completed, enter the `admin` directory, and run `npm install`. Finally run `npm run production`. This will output the Admin files to `public/admin`, and will then be available at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` (or wherever you run Babble from).
                
                ```bash
                cd admin
                npm install
                npm run production
                ```
                
                _**Note:** There will likely be an easier way of installing both Babble and Babble Admin in the future, once a stable version is released._

            body: |
                Developing a Babble site is mostly about editing Yaml (models and content), Twig (templates) and CSS files.
                
                To provide the fastest possible workflow, Babble integrates with Livereload. Launch a Livereload compatible server, start Babble with the `--live-reload` flag, and the browser will automatically refresh when project files change.
                
                ### Example: Using "livereload" from NPM
                Remember: You can use any Livereload compatible server or application. For this example, we'll use the `livereload` package from NPM.
                
                First, we'll install `livereload`:
                ```bash
                npm install -g livereload
                ```
                
                Now we can start the `livereload` server and tell it to watch for changes in our project:
                ```bash
                livereload "content, templates, public" --exts "twig, yaml"
                ```
                
                Lastly, start the Babble development server with the `live-reload` flag:
                ```bash
                php babble serve --live-reload
                ```

            body: |
                When you want to publish your Babble website, the web server's user needs write access to a few directories in order for it to store uploaded files, cache, and update your site's content.
                
                ```bash
                mkdir public/uploads
                sudo chmod www-data public/uploads
                
                sudo chown -R www-data content
                sudo chown -R www-data cache
                ```
                
                If you want to use Babble's image cropping functionality, you need either GD or Imagick installed for PHP. On an Ubuntu server, you can run `sudo apt install php-imagick`.

            body: |
                If you don't need to access Babble Admin, or use any dynamic features on your site, you can build a static version of your website, containing only plain HTML files. This is great for performance, as every page load simply loads a pre-built HTML file, and no PHP is needed.
                
                Building a static version of your website is as simple as running:
                
                ```bash
                php babble build
                ```
                
                This command creates a `build` directory inside your project, which contains everything you need to upload to your web server. Then uploading is just a matter of opening your favorite FTP client, or calling an `rsync` or `scp` command:
                
                ```
                scp -r ./build/* user@yourserver:/var/www/example.com/
                
                # OR
                
                rsync -avzP --copy-links --delete -e "ssh -p 1234" build/ user@yourserver:/var/www/example.com/
                ```
